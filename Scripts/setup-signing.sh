# One-time setup: creates a stable, locally-trusted code-signing certificate
# in your login keychain so YouTube.app keeps the same signing identity
# across every rebuild.
#
# Without this, `build-app.sh` ad-hoc signs the app (`codesign --sign -`),
# which hashes the binary itself into the signature — so every rebuild
# produces a *different* identity. Keychain ties a stored item's access
# control to the exact identity that created it, so after any rebuild macOS
# no longer recognizes YouTube as "the same app" and prompts for your
# password to allow it access again. A stable identity fixes that.
#
# Safe to re-run: skips creation if the certificate already exists.
